      <div class="articleText">
        Recently my wife decided that I was going to clean up the basement. It made a lot of sense—It was just being
        used as storage for all the useless junk I had laying around. So she came up with the idea to finish it so that
        we (I) could have a place to hang out with guests (my friends).
        <br><br>
        Which was great. I could turn the basement into a little man-cave and we wouldn’t be bother by the kids running
        around and bothering the adults. It was a win-win. But during renovations, I ran into a snag.
        <br><br>
        See, I’m pretty handy. I can put down carpet, I can take care of drywall and painting. I’ll mess around with
        plumbing a little. But one thing I don’t touch is electrical work. I like to leave that to the professionals.
        Which is where I ran into a brick wall.
        <br><br>
        I needed lighting in the basement. It’s pretty dark down there and I don’t have any overhead lights or anything.
        So I had an electrician come over and check it out. Apparently, I have an old electrical box. If he was going to
        wire anything new to it, he’d have to replace the box, along with the wiring in the entire house.
        <br><br>
        $3000. Three grand. Thanks buddy, but I think I’ll get a second opinion.
        <br><br>
        So I did, but he told me the same thing. Same with the third guy.
        <br><br>
        It looked like I was out of options. I wasn’t about to spend $3000 in order to have overhead lights in my
        basement, that was just out of the question. But I did need some kind of lighting down there, and I didn’t want
        to rely on a few lamps. They never really light the room as well as you want.
        <br><br>
        So I put the project on hold until I could find a better solution. Thing is, I’d already put some money into
        finishing it, so I didn’t want it to become another project that I’d started but never finished. I have enough
        of those already. So I started asking around.
        <br><br>
        I went to my local Home Improvement store and started asking the guys there if there was a cheaper option. Turns
        out, there is.
        <br><br>
        The guy told me about this light called “The <a class="articleLink"
          href="https://www.anstrex.com/?utm_campaign=referral&utm_sourc=lpgallery">Wireless
          FreeLight</a>.” Apparently, there’s no electrical work involved—in fact, the whole thing is wireless.
      </div>
      <div class="articleImg">
        <center><img src="ceiling2.jpg" width="100%"></center>
      </div>
      <div class="articleText">
        I was interested, so I went home and did some research. And I liked what I found.
        <br><br>
        The <a class="articleLink"
          href="https://www.anstrex.com/?utm_campaign=referral&utm_sourc=lpgallery">FreeLight</a>
        is an ultra-bright, energy efficient wireless LED light that mounts to the ceiling or wall. Because it’s LED, it
        never needs replacing, and because it’s wireless, it just runs on batteries.
        <br><br>
        I’d seen stuff like this on TV before, but I didn’t want some ceiling light that I was going to have to get up
        on a chair to push on and off every time I wanted to use it. But what’s great is that it comes with a switch
        that you mount to the wall. It’s programmable so you can control up to 20 lights from up to 100 feet away (even
        through walls) with just one switch. It also works as a dimmer, so you can go from low light all the way up to
        300 lumens of light. I had no idea what a lumen was, so I looked it up. Apparently, 300 lumens makes it the
        brightest indoor light on the market.
        <br><br>
        I was sold. I ordered a 3-pack, which arrived on my doorstep 3 days later.
        <br><br>
        Installation was simple. I just had to screw the lights into the ceiling and the switch into the wall and I was
        done. Took fifteen minutes, tops. I wasn’t timing, but I finished installing before I finished my beer, so that
        should give you an idea. I think my mom could install these things if she wanted to.
        <br><br>
        <div class="articleImg">
          <center><img src="ceiling4.jpg" width="100%"></center>
        </div>
        They worked just like advertised. The lights were super bright, completing illuminating my basement. They
        transformed it from a dim, dingy room into a welcoming hangout spot. And the LED lights are efficient. I
        installed mine three months ago and the batteries still haven’t run out.
        <br><br>
        If you have a dark room, closet, or garage that but you don’t want to pay to have a light fixture installed, you
        should check these out. Like I said, super easy to install and really brightens the room up. Definitely worth
        the value.
        <br><br>
        <strong>EDIT</strong>: A few days after writing this article, readers began flodding my inbox with photos of
        their own daily uses of the FreeLight.

            <span class="usersComments">Wow! Perfect size for my small closet! Replaced my old junk light and it fits
              well. If you have a small closet, this should work well, for a big walk-in closet, it might be good idea
              to pick up more than one. Anyway, much cheaper comparing to home improvement stores and electricians.

            <span class="usersComments">My closet suffers from being just around the corner from the bedroom light and
              too far from a convinient outlet to put a lamp in. And there's no way I'm shelling out thousands for such
              a minor fix. These wireless ceiling lights are a godsend!

            <span class="usersComments">These are perfect for my pantry which doesn't have a built in light or nearby
              outlet. Not enough natural gets in there so it's a real pain looking around. But not anymore! These cute
              ceiling lights solved all my problems with a handy wireless switch!
